# Java Practices Repository

Welcome to the **Java Practices** repository! This project serves as a collection of Java programming exercises and examples aimed at reinforcing and showcasing various concepts and techniques within the Java language.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`src/`**: Contains all the source code files, organized into packages based on the topic or concept being demonstrated.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**: Implementation of classes and objects to demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Design Patterns**: Examples of common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, and Observer.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implementations of various data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).
- **Java Standard Library Usage**: Practical use cases of Java's standard libraries and utilities.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the examples:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MustafaDoganguzel/Java-Practices.git
   ```
2. **Import into Your IDE**: Open your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and import the project.
3. **Navigate the `src/` Directory**: Browse through the packages and classes to find topics of interest.
4. **Run and Experiment**: Execute the main methods or test classes to see the concepts in action and modify the code to deepen your understanding.

## Contributions
